# Daniel Donohue: Webscraping Project

My third project was to write a webscraping script in Python.  I used the scrapy library to scrape post titles, number of votes, dates, links, and top comments for a selection of subreddits on reddit.com.  The pipeline.py file then dictates that these data be saved to a MongoDB database.  

Later I'll comment the code, and eventually do something with the data.
